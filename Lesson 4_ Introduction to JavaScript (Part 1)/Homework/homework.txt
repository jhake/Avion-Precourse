* Variables
    - They store values. They can be set to a value. And later be read.

* Strings
    - They are variables that contain text. For example, strings can contain "Hello, World!"

* Functions (arguments, `return`)
    - A function does something with the arguments they are given with and gives the result as the return value.

* `if` statements
    - if statements are used to make something conditional in the code. This is used if you don't want the code to run for every scenario.

* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
    - Boolean values are logic values. This is usually used by if statements too. Comparing two values returns a boolean value. For example `1 == 2` returns false, abd `1 == 1 returns true.
