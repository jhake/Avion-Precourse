* `for`
    - This is used for looping code until some conditional statement becomes false.
    - For example printing values from 1 to 10, the loop will be
        for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
            console.log(i);
        }

* `&&`, `||`, `!`
    - && is used if you have multiple conditional statements and want them all to be true
    - || is used if you have multiple conditional statements and want at least one of them to be true
    - ! is used to invert the boolean value of something (true will become false and vice versa)
